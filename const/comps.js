An ovulation test can accurately tell you when you are most likely to conceive if you have intercourse and can help you get pregnant faster. Ovulation tests work by identifying the rise in hormones that surge just before you release an egg, so you know when you should have sex to get pregnant. Measuring basal body temperature will only tell you you’ve ovulated after your ovary has released an egg, and since eggs only live for 12-24 hours, it may be too late to start trying that month. That is why Clearblue offers a wide range of ovulation tests and fertility monitoring products that detect the rise in the luteinising hormone (LH) or both LH and estrogen to help you better understand your body’s ovulation cycle and identify your fertile days to maximize your chances of getting pregnant naturally.",

This medication is an emergency contraceptive and should not be used as a regular form of birth control.

It also makes vaginal fluid thicker to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg (fertilization) and changes the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent attachment of a fertilized egg.",
